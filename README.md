# AI-Powered Retail Intelligence Copilot

## Overview
The AI-Powered Retail Intelligence Copilot is a conversational analytics backend system designed to help small and mid-sized retail businesses make data-driven decisions through natural language interactions.

Instead of navigating complex dashboards, users can ask questions like:
- "How are my sales performing this week?"
- "Which products are at risk of stockout?"
- "What pricing strategy should I use?"

The system analyzes sales, inventory, customer behavior, and trends to provide actionable insights and recommendations.
